# NOTE: if we want to install keras, do it with no deps:
# RUN pip install keras --no-deps (or try conda equiv)

TODO:
* test deploy to docker
* migrate to github ?
* develop travis for auto deployment

# Build
# docker build -t atnlp .
--> build and deploy to docker repo should be done in travis
--> instruction to build locally should be given for development
